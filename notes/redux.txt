Steps to create cart flow

- Created Store ie store.js 
    - configureStore() 
- Then we connected our store to the app in app.js 
    - we wrap all component inside <Provider store={storeName}>....</Provider> so that our app has access to the store 
- Then we created cartSlice.js 
    - This will contain below information 
        - name : It will be initial name 
        - initialState : default initial state of cart 
        - reducers : 
            - It will have action mapped to the function which needs to be called. 
            - It takes to parameter (state or action or both).
            - state : It will be holding the initial value
            - action : what action to be performed
            - It wont return anything directly modify the state
    - After creating the action and reducer we need to export both 
        - export const { addItem, removeItem, clearCart } = cartSlice.actions 
        - export default cartSlice.reducer;
- After creating the slice we need to put it to store
    - Add all reducer ie slices to the store
    - reducer: {
        cart: cartSlice,
        user:userSlice,
        },
- Now Read the data ie subscribe using below the hook 
    - useSelector => check header file
    - useDispatch => check add to cart button
