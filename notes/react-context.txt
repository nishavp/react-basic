React Context 
- Context provide a way to pass data throgh the component tree without having to pass props down manually at each entry level.
- In simple can be called as global space data where any component can have access to it.
- For eg. user details and its authentication, theme details etc

# THIS IS IN FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT METHOD
Code Example => Create file in util createContext and import where ever you need to show. Check header file
import { createContext } from "react";

const UserContext = createContext({
  // pass default data objects
  user: {
    name: "Nisha Prasad",
    email: "nisha@gmail.com",
    address: "Mumbai",
    job: "Developer",
    company: "Andheri",
    website: "Food Website",
  },
});

export default UserContext;
